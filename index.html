<h5> HTML And CSS Coding </h5>
<p> At the start HTML Confused me but when my teacher explained everything to me it stoped confusing me anymore.</p>

<h5> Overall Experience</h5>
        <p> I liked the Summer Camp but today it was our last lesson ... I am lucky because we had a very good teacher that explained with confidence and he was understanding the problems we had and he was helping us and explaining to us every single thing.</p>

        <p> I am very happy that i had a chance to learn something new and i am very grateful for that.</p>
<p> Thanks....</p>
